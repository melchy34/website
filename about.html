            <ul>
                <li><strong>School Management Team:</strong> 
                    The management team is saddled with the responsibility of identifying areas of needs or weakness in the school and reporting back to the Board of Directors for verification and action.</li>
                <li><strong>Parents/Teachers Association (PTA):</strong> The school has a working P.T.A whose meetings are convened once every term. This is to enable the school to rob minds with parents and teachers so as to draw from the assessment, criticism and commendation of the policies and programmes of the school and how they are being implemented for the welfare of the parents and teachers and to maintain healthy school business relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspectors From The Ministry of Education
                    SELF EVALUATION PROCESSES:</strong> The school authority takes seriously findings, criticism, and recommendations from inspectors from the State and Local Government Education Offices. Also, directives from the education policymakers received from time to time will be duly implemented. In this vein, the findings and the recommendations of the external education quality assurance team intermittently visiting the school form the hub of our continuous modus operandi.</li>
